Welcome to my page! I am a Filipino astrophysicist in the Astronomy PhD program at the University of Maryland College Park. I work with Professor Benedikt Diemer on large-scale magnetohydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. I previously worked with Professor Robert Fisher on large-scale simulations of type Ia supernovae at UMass Dartmouth, and Professor Ian Vega on theoretical astrophysics at the University of the Philippines Diliman.
