I will be presenting a research poster on my work in galactic magnetic fields at the upcoming [``Magnetic Fields and Cosmic Rays across Diverse Scales: What’s Next?"](https://cosmic-rays-magnetic-fields.sites.cfa.harvard.edu/overview) conference. The event will take place at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, from September 8–12, 2025.
